My personal dotfiles.

Dependencies:

For gnome-terminal you need to setup the tomorrow theme profile using the script from the [tomorrow theme website](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme).

To use syntastic you need to install tools for each language you work in, I have the following installed:

python - flake8

json - jsonlint

javascript - jshint
